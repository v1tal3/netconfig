Add Vendor Support
==================

Getting Started
---------------

Currently as of version 1.0b, NetConfig only support Cisco routers, switches, and firewalls, running IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, or ASA's.  However in version 1.1b, support was added for different vendors and different vendor model network devices.

This guide intends to document how to create a base device class for a vendor, as well as individual device model classes, for support with integrating into NetConfig.  Any new device classes that work successfully and are tested thoroughly may be submitted as a Pull Request for official integration into the overall project.

Create Base Devive Class
------------------------

The base device class is used for different vendors.  Currently, the only existing base device class is for Cisco, titled "cisco_base_device.py".  In this example, we will create a new base device class for vendor "Acme".

Before creating any files, make sure to SSH in to the NetConfig server as user 'netconfig', or switch over to the user 'netconfig' once logging in.

.. code-block:: text

    su - netconfig

File Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, the file is located in ~/netconfig/app/device_classes/device_definitions/acme_base_device.py.

.. code-block:: text

    cd ~/netconfig/app/device_classes/device_definitions
    touch acme_base_device.py
    vi acme_base_device.py

The basic structure of this file is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from base_device import BaseDevice
    
    class AcmeBaseDevice(BaseDevice):
        # functions go here

The file has a few base functions that are required by the overall NetConfig program.  As NetConfig grows its feature set, more required functions may be added, and will need to be added/updated in here as necessary.

All functions in here are expected to work with any/all network devices made by this vendor.  Model specific functions will go in the individual device model classes, explained at the end of this file.

Required Functions
""""""""""""""""""

These functions and their specific names are required for NetConfig, including the required inputs and expected outputs.  How they process the inputs in order to return the required output varies for each specific network vendor.

    def pull_version(self, activeSession):
        # Function logic goes here
        return resultsList


Create Individual Devive Type Class
-----------------------------------

The specific device type class is used for the same vendor (as created above).  However a different device type file needs to be created for each type of device that uses different commands, unique commands, or returns output differently than other models by the same vendor.Currently, the only existing device type classeses are for Cisco, which are "cisco_ios.py", "cisco_asa.py", and "cisco_nxos.py".  Note that NetConfig support both IOS and IOS-XE, however their commands and outputs are identical, so they both use "cisco_ios.py".  In this example, we will create a new base device class for vendor "Acme".

Before creating any files, make sure to SSH in to the NetConfig server as user 'netconfig', or switch over to the user 'netconfig' once logging in.

.. code-block:: text

    su - netconfig

File Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a new directory for the vendor.

.. code-block:: text

  mkdir ~/netconfig/app/device_classes/device_definitions/acme
  cd ~/netconfig/app/device_classes/device_definitions/acme

Create a new 'init' file

.. code-block:: text

    touch __init__.py
    vi __init__.py

Add the following lines into the file:

.. code-block:: python

    from acme_os import AcmeOS
    
    __all__ = ['AcmeOS']

Now create the new device file for Acme OS type devices:

.. code-block:: text

    touch acme_os.py
    vi acme_os.py

The basic structure of this file is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from ..acme_base_device import AcmeBaseDevice
    
    class AcmeOS(AcmeBaseDevice):
        # functions go here
        return x

The file has a few functions that are required by the overall NetConfig program.  As NetConfig grows its feature set, more required functions may be added, and will need to be added/updated in here as necessary.

All functions in here are expected to work with only this specific network device type, by this specific vendor.  Any functions that function identically, and are supported by this vendor across all of their device models/types, may go in the acme_base_device.py file instead.
